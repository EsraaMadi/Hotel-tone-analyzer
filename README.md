# Hotel Tone Analyzer

<br>

## Overview

Social media and online review sites encourage a ton of writing about your business or brand. With so much valuable data hidden in plain sight, you canâ€™t let it just sit there! we need to mine large samples of unstructured data easily with emotion detection and sentiment analysis.

Interpreting a text is not an easy thing to do.  showing you how much anger, joy, fear, disgust, or sadness are likely in the text needs a lot of processes to detect emotions.

A quick example, the sentence, "Sorry, can't make it." has a 50% likelihood of sadness. But if you change the period to an exclamation point, the likelihood of sadness drops to 38% and anger becomes the most dominant emotion.

<br>

**Tone Analyzer** is a service determines the emotional tone behind a series of words, used to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions and emotions expressed within an online mention.


Here we going to use one of common emotional or sentiment analysis APIs **IBM Tone Analyzer** to analysis text reviews of 1,000 hotels and get the total emotional tones for a hotel

#### [IBM Tone Analyzer](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/)
is one of the cognitive services provided by IBM Cloud. It can help us predict the emotions, tones and communication style of the text written by users (passed as input to the service).

To have an insight on the service and tones, try this [web interface](https://tone-analyzer-demo.ng.bluemix.net/).

## Components / Services Types:
In this project, we are going to implement and provide two services:
1. Hotel tone analyzer:
    - Using this service, you can pass a hotel name and get the normalized tone analysis for all its reviews. We cover these tones: anger, fear, joy, and sadness (emotional tones). analytical, confident, and tentative (language tones).
2. Hotel indexer:
    - By hitting this service, you can index all hotels data using Elasticsearch

## Solution Structure:
1. Preprocess the data to be in a format that could be provided for analyzer or indexer.
2. [Hotel tone analyzer](https://github.com/EsraaMadi/Hotel-tone-analyzer/blob/master/code/Hotel%20Analyzer.ipynb):
    - Use IBM Watson python lib to get tones for each review of hotels in our Datasets.
    - For each hotel, calculate the normalized score for the detected tones, aggregate them all and get a final score.
    - Show the final tones scores as a bar chart.
3. [Hotel indexer](https://github.com/EsraaMadi/Hotel-tone-analyzer/blob/master/code/Hotel%20Indexer.ipynb):
    - Create one document for each hotel that contains all hotel data plus obtained tones from IBM API.
    - Use Elasticsearch to index all documents from the previous step.
4. Provide the above two services as [web service](https://github.com/EsraaMadi/Hotel-tone-analyzer/tree/master/code/flask-app) using flask.

## Datasets
The dataset used in this project is taken from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/hotel-reviews#7282_1.csv)

This dataset is a list of about 1,000 hotels and 30,000 reviews. The dataset includes hotel location, name, rating, review data, title, username, and more.

For more information about dataset columns, you can check this [data dictionary](https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/business-data-schema)
